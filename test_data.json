You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us .\r\nPerformance of Contract means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.\r\nComply with a legal or regulatory obligation means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject to.\r\nInternal Third Parties\r\nOther companies in the MarketOne Group acting as joint processors and who are based in the United States, Canada, Barbados, the United Kingdom, India, Singapore, Japan and Australia and provide IT and system administration services and undertake leadership reporting.\r\nExternal Third Parties\r\nService providers acting as processors based in the United States, Canada, Barbados, the United Kingdom, India, Singapore, Japan and Australia who provide IT and system administration services.\r\nProfessional advisers acting as processors including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers based in the United States, Canada, Barbados, the United Kingdom, India, Singapore, Japan and Australia who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services.\r\nLocal regulators and other authorities acting as processors based in the United States, Canada, Barbados, the United Kingdom, India, Singapore, Japan and Australia who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.\r\nYour legal rights\r\nYou have the right to:\r\nRequest access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. To make a data subject access request, please send us an email .\r\nRequest correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.\r\nRequest erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.\r\nObject to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.\r\nRequest restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.\r\nRequest the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.\r\nWithdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.\r\nI'd like to receive:\r\nYou're welcome to review our privacy policy .\r\nEmail address\r\nThank you for subscribing.\r\n",

      "Policy Text": "Privacy Policy:\r\nNathan Jenkins (\"Nath042\") operates nath042.com and may operate other websites. It is Nath042's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.\r\nWebsite Visitors\r\nLike most website operators, Nath042 collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Nath042's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Nath042's visitors use its website. From time to time, Nath042 may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.\r\nNath042 also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on nath042.com blogs/sites. Nath042 only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.\r\nGathering of Personally-Identifying Information\r\nCertain visitors to Nath042's websites choose to interact with Nath042 in ways that require Nath042 to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Nath042 gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up  at nath042.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Nath042 are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Nath042 collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Nath042. Nath042 does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.\r\nAggregated Statistics\r\nNath042 may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Nath042 may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Nath042 does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.\r\nProtection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information\r\nNath042 discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Nath042's behalf or to provide services available at Nath042's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Nath042's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Nath042 will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Nath042 discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Nath042 believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Nath042, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Nath042 website and have supplied your email address, Nath042 may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Nath042 and our products.  If you send us a request (for example via email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Nath042 takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.\r\nCookies\r\nA cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Nath042 uses cookies to help Nath042 identify and track visitors, their usage of Nath042 website, and their website access preferences. Nath042 visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Nath042's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Nath042's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.\r\nBusiness Transfers\r\nIf Nath042, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Nath042 goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Nath042 may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.\r\nAds\r\nAds appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Nath042 and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.\r\nPrivacy Policy Changes\r\nAlthough most changes are likely to be minor, Nath042 may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Nath042's sole discretion. Nath042 encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a nath042.com account, you might also receive an alert informing you of these changes.

The types of Personal Information collected may include your name, email address, phone number, birthday, and location. We automatically receive your location when you use the Services.

Information you provide to one of our Services may be used with other Services you or your company use.
